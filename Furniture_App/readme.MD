Furniture Company Program   
Write an application for a furniture company; the program determines the price of a table.

Ask the user to choose 1 for pine, 2 for oak, or 3 for mahogany.
The output is the name of the wood chosen as well as the price of the table.
Pine tables cost $100, oak tables cost $225, and mahogany tables cost $310.
If the user enters an invalid wood code, set the price to 0.
When the user creates an order, use an object oriented class to contain the information.  
A class called Order should have the wood type and constants for the costs of each type of table.  
The class should have a method to get the price.  
The constructor should accept the type of wood as a parameter.  
Save the main class as FurnitureTest.java.
Add a prompt to the application to ask the user to specify a (1) large table or a (2) small table, but only if the wood selection is valid.

Add $35 to the price of any large table, and add nothing to the price for a small table.
Display an appropriate message if the size value is invalid, and assume the price is for a small table.
